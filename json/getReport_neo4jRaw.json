It\nconsists of 860.17 g, 7.2 cm medial to lateral, 6.3 cm anterior to posterior\nand 4.0 cm superior to inferior portion of oriented yellow lobulated adipose\ntissue.  The specimen is inked according to orientation serially sectioned\nfrom medial to lateral into 13 slices.  Sectioning reveals a 1.9 x 1.6 x 1.2\ncm tan-white, firm mass in slices 11 and 12.  The mass is approximately 0.4 cm\nfrom the nearest superior margin, 0.5 cm from the nearest anterior margin, 1.0\ncm from the nearest inferior margin, 1.2 cm from the nearest lateral margin,\n1.5 cm from the nearest posterior margin and 5.0 cm from the nearest medial\nmargin.  Embedded within the mass in slice 11 is a silver metallic radioactive\nseed (Rx #529600).  Embedded within the mass in slice 12 is a silver metallic\nwing shaped biopsy clip.  The remainder of the specimen is composed of\napproximately 95% yellow lobulated adipose tissue and 5% dense white fibrous\ntissue.

It\nconsists of 860.17 g, 7.2 cm medial to lateral, 6.3 cm anterior to posterior\nand 4.0 cm superior to inferior portion of oriented yellow lobulated adipose\ntissue.  The specimen is inked according to orientation serially sectioned\nfrom medial to lateral into 13 slices.  Sectioning reveals a 1.9 x 1.6 x 1.2\ncm tan-white, firm mass in slices 11 and 12.  The mass is approximately 0.4 cm\nfrom the nearest superior margin, 0.5 cm from the nearest anterior margin, 1.0\ncm from the nearest inferior margin, 1.2 cm from the nearest lateral margin,\n1.5 cm from the nearest posterior margin and 5.0 cm from the nearest medial\nmargin.  Embedded within the mass in slice 11 is a silver metallic radioactive\nseed (Rx #529600).  Embedded within the mass in slice 12 is a silver metallic\nwing shaped biopsy clip.  The remainder of the specimen is composed of\napproximately 95% yellow lobulated adipose tissue and 5% dense white fibrous\ntissue.  Representative to include the mass in its entirety are submitted from\nmedial to lateral and an individual sections from anterior to posterior and\ninferior to superior as follows:\n1A-1B- slice 1, medial, perpendicular\n1C-1F- slice 11 (closest anterior, posterior, superior, inferior and lateral\nmargins to the mass)\n1G- slice 12, mass blocked out\n1H- slice 12, mirror image of mass\n1I- slice 3, fibrous tissue to include margins\n1J- slice 5, fibrous tissue to include margins\n1K- slice 7, fibrous tissue to include margins\n1L- slice 9, fibrous tissue to include margins\n1M-1Q- slice 13, lateral, perpendicular\nBlock 1-left breast tumor\nBlock 2-left breast normal\nGTBQA Study:\n1C-1F-full face tumor (slice 11)\n1C-1F-periphery\n1G-1H-full face tumor (slice12)\n1G-1H- full face section\nPhoto attached\nInking key:\nAnterior- orange\nPosterior- black\nSuperior- red\nInferior- green\nMedial- blue\nLateral- yellow\nCold Ischemic Time:  47 minutes.\nFormalin Exposure Time:  55 hours and 3 minutes.\nPart 2 is received labeled with the patient's name, initials CAP, and \"left\naxillary sentinel node biopsy #1, Blue 1300\".  It consists of a 4.2 x 2.1 x\n1.2 cm portion of yellow lobulated adipose tissue.  Dissected from the adipose\ntissue is a 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm tan-pink possible lymph node.  The possible\nlymph node is serially sectioned at 2 mm intervals and entirely submitted in\ncassettes 2A through 2B.\nFormalin exposure time:  57 hours and 2 minutes.\nPart 3 is received labeled with the patient's name, initials CAP, and \"left\naxillary sentinel node biopsy #2, not Blue 1300\".  It consists of a 2.5 x 1.6\nx 0.6 cm portion of partially cauterized yellow lobulated adipose tissue.\nDissected from the adipose tissue is a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm tan-pink possible\nlymph node.  The possible lymph node is serially sectioned at 2 mm intervals\nand the specimen is entirely submitted as follows:\n3A- possible lymph node\n3B- surrounding adipose tissue\nFormalin exposure time:  57 hours and 2 minutes.\nPart 4 is received labeled with the patient's name, initials CAP, and \"new\nlateral margin\".  It consists of an 11.1 g, a 6.0 x 3.7 x 1.8 cm portion of\nunoriented yellow lobulated fibroadipose tissue.  The specimen is serially\nsectioned to reveal a cut surface composed of approximately 95% yellow\nlobulated adipose tissue and 5% densely fibrous tissue.  No discrete masses or\nlesions are grossly identified.  Representative sections are submitted in\ncassettes 4A through 4E.\nFormalin exposure time:  57 hours and 2 minutes.\nalo\nAXO1//AXO1/AXO1\nMICROSCOPIC:\nMicroscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.\ncaa\n\nThe following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu\nHybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and\nImmunofluorescent Testing:\nThe testing was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nthe Institution, as required by the CLIA\n'88 regulations.
