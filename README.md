# DeepPhe-Viz

Visualization of cancer patient summaries as generated by the DeepPhe NLP tools.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following tools install to build this project:

- [Oracle Java SE Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3.x](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Neo4j 3.2.1](https://neo4j.com/) is used to store the graph output

## Getting Started

First download/clone the `DeepPhe-Viz` repo and do a maven build:

````
git clone https://github.com/DeepPhe/DeepPhe-Viz.git
cd DeepPhe-Viz
mvn clean package
````
Then put your neo4j database connection username and password in `conf/application.conf`. Then from command line execute: 

````
./activator run
````

This will start the web server on port 9000 by default. You can go to http://localhost:9000/patients/Patient02 (or any other patient number from your dataset) to see the result.

Note: you can type `lsof -i :9000` to see if port 9000 is being used. And if you need to run this viz on a different port, say 8282, just type `./activator "run 8282"`.
